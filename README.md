# DailyWordCard

# In a Nutshell
Create a single-screen “Word of the Day” experience that displays a randomly selected word and definition in a clean, focused card layout, with a one-tap button to hear both read aloud via Text-to-Speech.

# Description
You’re halfway through your morning coffee when your brain reminds you: “We agreed to learn one new word a day, remember?” But dictionaries are long. Flashcards are lost. And your cat sat on your notes. Thankfully, a genius idea hits: a minimalist app that serves one word and its meaning daily, spoken aloud so even your half-asleep self can absorb it. Sounds great, right?

Yeah, well… now you have to build it—time to ship that Word of the Day screen.
